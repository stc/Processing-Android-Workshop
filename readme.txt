This Code is GPL_v3 Licensed unless otherwise stated. It uses several processing libraries including Ketai for Android, Toxiclibs for simulation, Maxim for cross platform sound generation. The code projects are both individually built examples along with modified
example files of these libraries.

Processing sketches are working on Android version 2.3+ at the moment.
